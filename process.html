                <p class="body">
                    The website does a good job in many ways. It's packed with useful information, has attractive images
                    that keep things interesting, and maintains a consistent design throughout. This makes it easy for
                    users to find what they need and recognize the site wherever they encounter it.
                    <br><br>However, there's always room for improvement. One major area to address is responsiveness.
                    Right now, the website looks fantastic on desktops, but navigating it on phones or tablets can be a
                    struggle. The menu doesn't shrink down as it should, and the layout doesn't adjust to smaller
                    screens. This means a significant portion of users might miss out on the great content we offer.
                    <br><br>Another area for improvement is readability. While the consistent design is a plus, some
                    parts of the website lack color contrast. This makes the text difficult to read, which can be
                    frustrating for visitors.
                    <br><br>Finally, the website can feel a little cluttered at times. Simplifying the layout by
                    reducing the amount of information on each page and streamlining the navigation menu would make it
                    easier for users to find what they're looking for and improve the overall user experience.

                <h2 class="headline">Design Brief</h2>
                <p class="body">
                    The current website suffers from a lack of visual clarity and a structure that can be confusing for
                    visitors. This makes it difficult for users to find the information they need and navigate the site
                    effectively. To address these problems, Iâ€™m planning a comprehensive redesign that focuses on visual
                    design, responsiveness, and a streamlined site structure.
                    <br><br>One of the key improvements will be in the visual design. I'll be introducing a color
                    palette that provides greater contrast, making text and important elements easier to read. Visual
                    hierarchy will be established, guiding the user's eye to the most important information on each
                    page.
                    <br><br>Responsiveness is another crucial aspect of the redesign. With more and more people
                    accessing websites on mobile devices, it's essential that the site adapts seamlessly to different
                    screen sizes. This will ensure a positive user experience regardless of the device being used.
                    <br><br>To improve the site structure, I'll be combining redundant pages and reducing the overall
                    amount of information presented on each page. This will make the site less cluttered and easier to
                    navigate. The content will be carefully curated to ensure it remains informative and relevant to the
                    user's needs.
                    <br><br>Finally, I'll be providing design templates for core pages such as Home, About Us, Contact,
                    Services, and Resources. These templates will ensure a consistent user experience across the entire
                    website, while still allowing for some flexibility in the way content is presented on each page.
